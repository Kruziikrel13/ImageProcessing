Both Test and Test_Large use unix diff to compare serial output images and parallel images generated by the program to verify the parallel implementation is in parity with the serial implementation in terms of the resultant images produced.

# Running the scripts
Ensure you are executing the test scripts from the same directory as the `parallel` and `serial` binaries as well as `shaders/processors.spv`

You can override the default path to pictures input directory by passing

Profile
--------
Requires perf to run. Don't test on large dataset as generated perf report takes up 75GB+ of space.

Test
----
Uses smaller dataset, of course, quicker execution time.

Test_Large
-----------
Uses large dataset, will take longer, has more varying images to test performance against. May take quite a while for serial to execute.
